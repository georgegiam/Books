Nation State hackers do work under a government and their purpose is to disrupt or set in danger adversary governments, organisations or individuals and even to cause national incidents.\
In our case Nation State hackers aim for the elections in order to disrupt and manipulate the whole process. \
Their motivation could be the facilitations which could be offer a candidate in business activities of the attacking country (eg. Better commercial circumstances or cases related to national defence and security)\

\
Two of the most popular Nation States attacks are data breaches and DDoS.\
The reason of the first attack (data breach) is the leak of crucial information that can be helpful while the reason of the second attack (DDoS) is the disruption of the target system.\
The same strategy was implemented here as well. At first a data breach attack to the servers of the router manufacturer resulted in leaking crucial information (detailed design and technical specification of produced devices). Finally the manipulation of the election system was achieved by using this information and by performing a DDoS attack.

Cybercriminals are professional hackers which act in groups or even individually and their aim is their financial growth.\
In our case Cybercriminals aim the elections and their motivation could be financial. \
More specifically they could aim to gain a ransom in order to allow the election processes to be proceed normally and to avoid absence of government for extended time.\

Data brech attack and DDoS is also some of the Cybercriminal\'92s most popular attacks. Holding crucial information by a data breach attack can offer money to the attacker by demanding a ransom. In the same way a DDoS attack can offer money to the attacker (by demanding ransom).\
However, in our case Cybercriminals strategy wasn\'92t to earn money by the data breach attack. Instead they strategy was to use the data from the first attack (data breach) in order to implement the second attack (DDoS) from which they could ask for ransom. \ul \

Hactivist\'92s activities are related to ideological beliefs.\
In this case hacktivists have ideologically motivation. For instance they could disagree with the political ideas of the current government and they try to weaken it.\
Furthermore there is a possibility that Hacktivist\'92s ideas could be closer to another candidate political group. \
Finally this attack could be in order for the Hacktivists to express their \uc0\u945 rgumnets about the election process.\

Hacktivist\'92s purpose is the disturbance of the whole election process in order to express the different ideology.\
Therefore, in our case Hacktivist\'92s strategy is to set the election system out of order and freeze the whole process. This is the reason they selected the DDoS attack. Nevertheless, in order to accomplish this attack, some other important data are required (detailed design and technical specification of produced devices). These data have successfully came to their hands by performing a data breach attack.\

\
Reconnaissance phase is related to the attempt of the adversary to collect as much as possible information related to the target before the initial attack take place. In our case (attack of the 1st step of the kill chain) we have to deal with an attack to the router\'92s manufacture database. \
In the reconnaissance phase in this attack, hackers tried to collect the employee\'92s emails in order to forward them he malicious PDF.\

\
Weaponization phase is about the preparation of cyber weapons that are going to be used in the attack.\
In this case the hackers used a malicious PDF file. Malicious PDF files (most of the times embedded with payloads) it is always a very simple way of infecting the target\'92s machine, because this type of documents are very popular and its is used almost by everyone.\

This phase is about the cyber weapon is delivered to the target.\
In this case the malicious PDF was delivered through an email. To be precise, hackers attached the malicious PDF inside an email and they send it to an employee. The employee, opened the email and therefore the malicious PDF without having knowledge of the consequences. As a result he/her gave remote access to his/her to the hackers.\

This phase is related to the payload execution. In out case the payload was executed through a PDF file. In more details PDF documents is an object oriented format document so the data inside it (images, font types etc.) are called objects. Each object acts in its own way while the the file is opened. So, hackers added one more object in this PDF. This object was a piece of code (malicious) which is executed every time the file is opened. \

In this phase we examine the way the payload remained persistence. In this attack hackers wanted from the victim to open the PDF document, then the payload be executed and finally this payload activated every time automatically. Hackers achieved this maybe by giving the payload the ability to be executed automatically every time the victim\'92s computer was rebooted. The folder may be added to the list of the programs that are run automatically on startup.\

Command and control phase is about establishing communication between the attacker and victim. In our case hackers succeed to gain access to the victim\'92s computer through a PDF payload. There are many PDF payloads. One of the is the payload that can give remote access to the attacker. Now, after the payload installed and executed, a connection was opened between the attacker\'92s computer and the victim\'92s computer. This payload gave the attacker the opportunity to use the victim\'92s computer maybe with a terminal. As a result the attackers were sending commands an the payload was answering with server\'92s information.\

This is the reconnaissance phase of the second set of the attack. In this case hackers had already crucial technical information about the routers. The next step was to map the router\'92s functionality and search for possible vulnerabilities. So, they have maybe searched for any open ports in order to exploit it. The could have also search for important router\'92s information (last update of the OS, new features, version). Finally hackers could have search and collect information about any possible firewall in order to overpass it.\

In this phase the cyber weapon (which is the botnet) delivered to the target (router) through a zero-day vulnerability. Hackers used this vulnerability in order to install the Bonet in the routers. This vulnerability could have been an open port like port 21 (FTP). As a result hacker forwarded the botnet through FTP in the routers and then they installed it. The installation process could have been achieved because another port like 22 (SSH) could have been also open. Thus, hacker could also have access in a terminal and they were able to execute commands.\

This phase related to the way the botnet remains installed and activated in the router. Also the botnet should be automatically activated after a reboot. In order for the botnet to automatically activated, hackers may have been flag it as an important process so when the router is activated then the botnet is activated too. Hackers also had to think about a possiblee reboot or a format. For this reason they maybe thought that every time a new router is activated and connected to the network, another already activated and connected router send the botnet to the new router. As a result the botnet is always installed and ready to run in every rooter.\

This phase describes the way the botnet was communicationg with the server in which the election system was stored. This server was open and accessible from every single device in order for the citizens to be able to vote. As a result the infected routers had also access to the server. The way with which the botnet was communicating with the server was a simple network. The internet. Through this the infected routers was connected to the server and was sending multiple request.\

From the first attack hackers achieved to gain some very important and crucial technical information about the routers. Next, by using these information the exploit a zero-day vulnerability and took the control of the routers by installing in them the botnets. Their initial purpose was to make a DDoS attack by using the botnet. So they did. Hackers finally achieved to do the DDoS attack and and set the election system out of order which resulded in the freezing of the election process. \

The first comment is about the time needed from each attack in order to find the passwords.\
The incremental mode supports 10 different entropy sources from which different combinations arise. (ASCII, LM_ASCII, Alnum, Alpha, LowerNum, UpperNum, LowerSpace. Lower, Upper, Digits).\
In our case we haven\'92t select any of these sources. As a result the incremental mode will try to make combinations by using all the 10 sources. Thus, it will take a lot of time until find the suitable combination that matches with the password we are searching for.\
On the other hand, when we use the dictionary the time needed is reduced significantly as the dictionary contains less combinations and as a result the comparisons will be less.\
The second comment is related to the type of passwords found in each type of attack.\
We notice that in the brute force attack the password found is a simple password with only 6 different digits. Therefore this password was found very fast as only the \'93Digits\'94 entropy source needed.\
However, the dictionary attack gave us more complicated passwords. Brute force attack would take too long to find them because they would need many more combinations.\
